# Using Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks to create model for predicting asl hand signs.

## Purpose

*Trained Logistic Regression and CNN model to classify the ASL alphabet, employing Python, pandas, and data analysis methodologies, all within AI4ALL's cutting-edge AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.*


## Problem Statement

*Given that some schools and colleges lack the resources to offer ASL programs, we intended to create a platform that would serve this purpose. Another area of key impact we wanted to provide was to make sure the application of machine learning for gesture recognition in ASL demonstrates a tangible way that artificial intelligence can be harnessed to improve accessibility and education outcomes.*

## Key Results

*Achieved an accuracy of 98.26% on the test dataset, successfully classifying hand signs across multiple ASL letters.*

## Methodologies

*To accomplish this, we preprocessed the ASL image dataset, visualized it using a correlation matrix, used 80% the data for training and 20% for testing sets, trained a logistic regression and CNN model using pandas, and evaluated its performance using classification metrics.*
