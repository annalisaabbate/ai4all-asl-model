# Using Logistic Regression to create model for predicting asl hand signs.

Briefly describe the purpose/result(s) of your project, the skills you applied, and the AI4ALL Ignite program.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Uncovered and meticulously analyzed three distinct biases present in ChatGPT, employing advanced Python techniques and data analysis methodologies, all within AI4ALL's cutting-edge AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.*


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->
Describe the motivation for this project, why it is relevant, and what its impacts are.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Given the substantial daily output of responses, the identification and mitigation of ChatGPT's biases become critical, safeguarding both the multitude of users and the far-reaching consequences they may influence.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. *Achieved an accuracy of 53% on the test dataset, successfully classifying hand signs across multiple ASL letters.*

## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

*To accomplish this, we preprocessed the ASL image dataset, visualized it using a correlation matrix, used 80% the data for training and 20% for testing sets, trained a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn, and evaluated its performance using classification metrics.
